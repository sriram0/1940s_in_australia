    <div class="m" id="0">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        The 1940s were an eventful decade in Australia's history. It saw most of World War II, including many campaigns and the Darwin bombing, as well as the first Yacht Race. Also found in this decade is the formation of the UN and the improvement of penicillin, along with a shift in agriculture and clothing.

        <h2>The Allies</h2>
        On the third of January, 1941, Australia joined the Allies. 19 days later, Allied forces captured Tobuk, a Libyan port city close to the Egyptian border. Later that year on the ninth of Decemebr, Australia officially declared war against Japan. This led 188 Japanese aircraft to attack Darwin on the 19<sup>th</sup> of February, 1942, causing 243 casualties. Australia then decided to bring its armies back to defend against furthur attacks. Just four days earlier, Japan had already taken the colony of Singapore from British forces. The following month, the HMAS Perth was sunk by Japanese torpedoes at Sunda Strait near Malaysia and Indonesia. Then, on the 8<sup>th</sup> of June, Sydeny was attacked by more Japanese. On May 15<sup>th</sup> of the following year, another ship was sunk by Japanese near Brisbane, taking 268. Japanese forces then proceeded the take Kokoda, a town in Papa New Guinea, what was then Australian territory. It was only in Novemeber that year when Australia took it back. In June of 1943, the rationing of butter and linen began.

        <h2>ANZAC</h2>
        The 21<sup>st</sup> of January, 1944, is when the Australia-New Zealand, or ANZAC, pact was established. Meat rationing began at the same time. In August that year, hundreds of Japanese break out of a camp in Cowra, a town in New South Wales. 234 Japanese and 3 Australians die in the breakout. Reginal William Saunder becomes the first Aboriginal officer in the Australian Army two months after this. Finally, on the 8<sup>th</sup> of May, 1945, Germany surrendered to the Allied Forces, ending war in Europe. On the fifteenth of August that year, Japan gave in as well, signalling the conclusion of World War II.<br><br>

        <h2>Olympics & the Yacht Race</h2>
        On the 26<sup>th</sup> of December, 1945, the first Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race was held. Captain John Illingworth took the victory with a time of six days, fourteen hours and twenty-two minutes. In August of 1948, the first Olympics since 1936 due to the war was held in London. Australia won 2 gold medals, 6 silver medals and 5 bronze medals, ranking 14<sup>th</sup> over all.

        <h2>The United Nations and Penicillin</h2>
        On the 24<sup>th</sup> of October, 1945, the United Nations came into existence with 29 founding nations, including Australia. Three years later, the first UN Declaration of Human Rights was enforced and Australia played an important part in its creation, although First Nations People were yet to be included. It was December that year when Australian Professor Howard Florey won a Nobel Prize for his furthur improvement of Penicillin, which has been used in Australia since 1944.

        <h2>Agriculture</h2>
        The 1920s and 30s saw a boom in wheat production in a region in South Australia called the Murray Mallee, near the Victorian border and the Murray River. Wheat was important at the time because of its drought tolerance. The explosion in wheat farming caused major soil erosion, leading to blocked roads and highways, smothered fields and destroyed fences. This, along with the emu rampage of 1932, forced many farmers to abandon wheat cultivation for livestock husbandry after the Second World War.

        <h2>Entertainment and Clothing</h2>
        The more popular forms of entertainment during the 1940s were melodramas, musicals, opera and ballet, basically things you can find on stage. Movies wouldn't have been invented for another four decades and the popularity of novels was yet to rise. The early 1940s saw a return in neck frills and sashes before clothing rationing began due to World War 2.
